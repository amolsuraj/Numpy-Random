# Numpy-Random
Numpy Random : If there is a program to generate random number it can be predicted, thus it is not truly random.  Random numbers generated through a generation algorithm are called pseudo random. We do not need truly random numbers, unless its related to security (e.g. encryption keys) or the basis of application is the randomness (e.g. Digital roulette wheels).
